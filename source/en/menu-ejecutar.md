### Pause

Click this item to pause a continuous execution. When an execution is paused, you can continue it by pressing "Start" (continuous execution) or "Step" (step by step execution).


### Step

Click this item to start or continue a step by step execution. Every time you press this button the simulation steps one clock cycle.
